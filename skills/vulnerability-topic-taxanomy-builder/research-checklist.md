# Research Checklist

Use this checklist during Phase 2 to ensure saturation across all source categories.

## Pre-Research

- [ ] Topic clearly defined with boundaries
- [ ] Initial axis hypothesis formed (will be revised)
- [ ] Year range for prioritization established (default: current year + previous year)

## Category A: CVEs and Bug Bounties

- [ ] Search 1: `{topic} CVE {current_year} {prev_year}`
- [ ] Search 2: `{topic} bug bounty writeup`
- [ ] Optional 3: `{topic} vulnerability disclosure {specific_product}`
- [ ] Extracted: CVE IDs, CVSS, affected products, root causes, bounty amounts

## Category B: Academic Papers and Conference Talks

- [ ] Search 1: `{topic} BlackHat DEF CON {current_year}`
- [ ] Search 2: `{topic} paper USENIX IEEE ACM {current_year}`
- [ ] Search 3: `{topic} research new technique {current_year}`
- [ ] Optional 4: `{topic} differential fuzzing`
- [ ] Optional 5: `{topic} taxonomy classification`
- [ ] Extracted: Paper titles, classification frameworks proposed, novel primitives, tool names
- [ ] Fetched full text for 2-3 most important papers (via web_fetch)

## Category C: Practitioner Blogs and Writeups

- [ ] Search 1: `{topic} attack techniques bypass`
- [ ] Search 2: `PortSwigger {topic} research` or `{topic} HackTricks`
- [ ] Optional 3: `{topic} exploit chain real world`
- [ ] Extracted: Technique names, payload patterns, creative combinations

## Category D: Defensive Research and Tools

- [ ] Search 1: `{topic} detection tool scanner fuzzer`
- [ ] Search 2: `{topic} defense mitigation WAF`
- [ ] Extracted: Tool names, detection approaches, known blind spots

## Category E: Emerging / Bleeding Edge

- [ ] Search 1: `{topic} new attack {current_year}`
- [ ] Search 2: `Top 10 web hacking techniques {current_year} {topic}`
- [ ] Extracted: New primitives, PoCs, award nominations

## Post-Research Verification

- [ ] Total unique techniques identified: _____ (target: 30-70)
- [ ] All techniques can be assigned to an Axis 1 category
- [ ] At least 3 techniques from the current year
- [ ] At least 2 CVEs with bounty amounts or CVSS scores
- [ ] At least 3 detection/offensive tools identified
- [ ] Research notes template is populated

## Saturation Test

The research is saturated when:
- [ ] Last 3 searches produced no new technique types (only new instances of known types)
- [ ] Every axis 1 category has at least 3 subtypes
- [ ] The CVE table has entries spanning at least 2 years
